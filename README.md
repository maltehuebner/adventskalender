# Adventskalender

This is a really quick and dirty calendar, made for my girlfriend.

The calendar is just PHP and Bootstrap and reads its configuration from an xml file.

It uses Bootstrap to show 24 boxes and each box can carry a title, a description and a link. I use the link to guide her to a Dropbox Folder where she can download images from our holidays or vouchers or stuff like that.

Yeah, and I am really not good with gifts and stuff.

## Configuration

Just take a look into the `days.xml` file. It is not hard to understand.
